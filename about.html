          <p>The root causes of mass incarceration are poverty and overcriminalization. Poverty contributes significantly to the United States’ high rate of imprisonment, which has disproportionately affected low-income populations. While it is difficult to ascertain whether poverty makes someone more likely to commit a crime, data show it does make a person more susceptible to being arrested and more likely to be charged with a harsher crime and to receive a longer sentence. The criminal bail system also punishes impoverished people who can't afford bail.</p>

        <h3>People of Color</h3>
        <div class="aboutItem impactDiv">
          <img src="assets/racism.jpg" />
          <p>Data shows that after accounting for poverty, racial disparities in incarceration rates persist. Of people in prison for drug offenses, nearly 80 percent in federal prison and 60 percent in state prisons are Black or Latino, despite historical data showing that, on average, Whites are just as, if not more, likely to use illicit drugs. Going to prison is a major life-altering event that creates obstacles to building stable lives in the community, such as gaining employment and finding stable and safe housing after release. Imprisonment also reduces lifetime earnings and negatively affects life outcomes among children of incarcerated parents.</p>

        <h3>Mentally Ill</h3>
        <div class="aboutItem impactDiv">
          <img src="assets/mentallyIll.jpg" class="grayscaleImg"/>
          <p>A disproportionate amount of people in prison suffer from mental illness.  Currently, the system simply warehouses the vast majority of people with mental illness, and few people in the system receive effective treatment. Almost 40% of people in state and federal prisons are struggling with some type of diagnosed mental illness. Prisons and jails often cause further mental harm to many incarcerated people. Over a quarter of incarcerated people report that they experience significant psychological distress in their environment. This means that people who dealt with trauma early in life are far more likely to be incarcerated in a prison system that can cause even more trauma on the mind and body, and then have very little access to the care that they need.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Funding: Incarceration vs. Education:</b> The U.S. makes up only 4.4 percent of the global population, yet it holds nearly a quarter of the world’s prisoners. Over the last 40 years, American prison populations have skyrocketed by 500 percent, costing the federal and state governments roughly $182 billion each year. Almost every state spends more money per prisoner than it does per student in public schools — and in 20 states, the difference between per-inmate and per-student spending is more than $24,000. Overall, education spending in America loses out to the huge amounts of money flowing into prisons.
            </li>
            <li><b>Does Mass Incarceration Keep Communities Safe?</b>  Due to heavily racialized and prejudiced filing and case proceedings, African Americans are a majority of innocent defendants wrongfully convicted of crimes and later exonerated. They constitute 47% of the 1,900 exonerations listed in the National Registry of Exonerations (as of October 2016), and the great majority of more than 1,800 additional innocent defendants who were framed and convicted of crimes in 15 large-scale police scandals and later cleared in “group exonerations.” Since 1973, at least 189 people who had been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death in the U.S. have been exonerated. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Power Abuse: </b>Ignorance causes further abuse of administrative, disciplinary, and judicial power. About 32,000 Americans died due to police violence from 1980 to 2019, researchers estimated in Thursday’s study, which analyzed data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several independently run databases of police killings. Even before the rise of police brutality, after the Civil War, state governments have created laws that undermined the 13th and 14th Amendments, segregating and disenfranchising Black communities and emancipated peoples.
